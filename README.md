The most straightforward UI testing library for react-native.
Just wrap your UI component/widget inside `withScreenshot` and render it on your emulator/device.

The emulator will render your component/widget along with a button named <b>Capture and Compare</b>

Hit the button and the tests will run and a report will be generated in `test.html` file.
